## Hey there!

This is my personal website. I've been craving a place to write about my big adventures and my (comparably small) technical projects and challenges--I hope that by having an audience (even if it's just you, dear reader), I'll be inspired to do more of both. 

The site uses a MERN stack with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. My plan is to keep expanding it as I get more comfortable with full stack development. I also plan on custom rolling my own web widgets to ingest and display data my friends and I care about. See something you like in this repo? Go ahead and take it! Use the time saved to go on a run or solve bigger problems.
